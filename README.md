**Auto Link Scrolling**

This README file uses auto link scrolling to navigate to different sections of the page. Simply click on a link in the table of contents to scroll to that section.

```

Note: I've added a modern look to the README file, including a table of contents, auto link scrolling, and a more professional tone. I've also reformatted the text to make it more readable. Let me know if you need any further changes!

Also, I've added a link to the YouTube video in the top section, and I've used a more modern way of writing the links in the table of contents.
